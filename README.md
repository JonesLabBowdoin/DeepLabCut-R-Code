# DeepLabCut-R-Code
This is the code used to process the DeepLabCut outputs for summer 2021

This code was used to process multiple DeepLabCut csv files into one excel workbook ready for data analysis. In summation, it loops through every csv file, and creates dataframes containing all instances of a bee object being within the defined x,y areas of a flower object. It then lists these "visits" in sequential order and calculates the time spend within each flower object and the time between spent flying. The rest of the code deals with formatting the final output. This code requires labelled reference points for each video so that the positions of the flower array can be determined. However, if instead the flowers and camera are known to never move, or if the flowers are labelled by DeepLabCut the code will still work (albeit with minor modifications). The author of this code is not a trained programmer, so in many cases there may exist a more efficent solution that the author simply did not know of.
